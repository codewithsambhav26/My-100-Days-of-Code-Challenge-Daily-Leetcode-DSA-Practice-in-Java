# 100 Days of Code Challenge â€” Java + DSA + Leetcode

**Started on: 29 July 2025**

Welcome to my **100 Days of Code** journey!  
Iâ€™m challenging myself to solve Leetcode problems, practice DSA concepts, and code daily in **Java**.  
This is to improve my problem-solving skills, consistency, and coding confidence ðŸš€  

---

## Goals of this Challenge:
- Solve at least **1-2 problems daily** on **Leetcode**
- Practice key **DSA topics** (Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Trees, DP, etc.)
- Write clean, optimized code in **Java**
- Share my learnings and approaches  
- Track progress publicly for accountability

##  My Approach:
- âœ… Focus on logic & patterns, not just brute-force
- âœ… Consistency > Quantity  
- âœ… Learn & revise concepts  
- âœ… Java + Clean Code Practices  
- âœ… Reflect & note key takeaways

## Why Iâ€™m doing this:  
- To improve problem-solving skills  
- Build consistency & coding discipline  
- Prepare for placements & contests  
- Share my journey with the community
